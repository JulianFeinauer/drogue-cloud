= Prepare the cluster

First we need to prepare the cluster.

== Minikube

[source,shell]
----
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 16384 --disk-size 20gb --addons ingress
----

Once the cluster is up and running, you need the start the load balancer tunnel in a new terminal,
as this command must be running until you shut down your cluster, or the tunnel.

[source,shell]
----
minikube tunnel
----

== Kind

Creating a new cluster with Kind only requires to execute the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kind create cluster
----

== Other

For any other cluster:

* You need to have a working context for `kubectl` (e.g. `oc login`).
* You will need to be able to create new namespaces, being _admin_ helps.
* You need some kind of `LoadBalancer` support. For OpenShift, you can use `Routes`.
* You must have `PersistentVolumes` available to bind to.
